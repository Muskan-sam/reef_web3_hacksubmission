## 2. Project Description - 
we use a lot of different applications on daily basis and receive reward coupons and loyalty points. but most of the time those loyalty points are used and they go wasted or expire. how to we save our points ? how can we make full use of those benefits in a innovative way?

## 3. Project Solution -
We developed a versatile system called DHUKAN. DHUKAN is a platform where all unused and useless loyalty tokens, rewards, and coupons can be standardised and converted into REEF values, which can then be used to purchase NFTs and respective loyalty tokens, rewards, and coupons of your choice. You can also earn points by referring DHUKAN to your friends.

## Objectives-
1. Redeem various loyalty prizes , tokens and vouchers from all possible applications and websites.
2. Influence and increased brand loyalty.
3. By integrating other variables like cash backs , points ,and tokens , we are able to reduce consumer price sensitivity .
4. Create consumer opposition to competing offers or products.

## Features -
1. Login / sign up :- you login with your credentials with valid inputs ( following the conditions for making an user id ) . You can login using email id and phone number and other formats ( google , Facebook , Apple ID)
2. Connect to reef wallet :- we convert the rewards , tokens and coupons into standardised units and convert into REEF value .
3. Market place.:- In this module we show to want and all industries we are connected to . ( My points , collection , auction )
* My points:- shows you the number of points collected and in return REEF value you get .
* Collection :- Shows all the Rewards , tokens , coupons and NFTs you have collected
* Auction:- If a person does not want the reward, he can either redeem it or put it up for auction. In auctions, we will provide you a limited time and set a base price in REEF value as well as a maximum limit.
4. Categorie:- cabs , food ,pharmaceuticals, courier and subscriptions , groceries
* Popular deals :- the most frequently used deals by the public or in demand deals .
5. NFTs:- Non Fungible tokens :- It's constructed using the same code as cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, but that's where the similarities end. Physical money and cryptocurrencies are "fungible," which means they can be traded for one another. We have also added the link to Sqwid , which is a NFT marketplace of REEF. People intrested in NFTs can buy them from there as well as sell their collected NFTs.
